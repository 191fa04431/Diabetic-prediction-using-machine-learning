Project Overview:

This Streamlit-based web application predicts diabetes risk using machine learning, allowing users to input key health parameters and receive an instant prediction.

🌟 Features
Interactive web interface
Real-time diabetes prediction
User-friendly input sliders
Machine learning model integration

🔬 Key Parameters:

The application considers six critical health indicators:

Age
Hypertension
Heart Disease
Body Mass Index (BMI)
HbA1c Level
Blood Glucose Level

🛠 Tech Stack:

Python
Streamlit
NumPy
Pickle (Model Serialization)
Machine Learning Model

📊 How It Works:

User inputs health parameters via sliders
Features are scaled using pre-computed mean and standard deviation
Trained model predicts diabetes probability
Result displayed as "Diabetic" or "Not Diabetic"

🚀 Quick Start:

bash
# Clone repository  
git clone <repository-url>
